# RSA-Encryption
The project aims to implement RSA encryption algorithm using C++.

My Project of the Discrete Mathematics Course Offered in Fall 2021 @ Zewail City.


## Encryption:

            1) Generate two large prime numbers. 
            2) Use the generated prime numbers to find the Private and the Public Keys of the RSA algorithm.
            3) Use the Public keys to cipher a plain text file.
            4) LDR and STR instructions with positive immediate offset (offset mode).
            5) Branch instruction

            1) Use the Private Keys to decipher a ciphered text file.
            2) Open a ciphered text file, decipher the contents and save the deciphered text in another file as a plain text.
            3) Control Hazards due to Branch or PC write
